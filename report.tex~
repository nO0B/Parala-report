\section{Why Parala}

About a year ago, Prof. Levin put me in touch with Dr. Madhav Gadgil who, in addition to being one of India's premier ecologists, is also deeply involved in conservation work in many parts of the country. After exchanging a few emails, we both felt that it was important for me to personally observe the problems that conservation in India is facing. As a result, he put me in touch with one of the founders of an NGO called `Bharatiya Lok va Paryavaran Vikas Sanstha' (Lokparyay for short).

This NGO works with tribal communities in a number of villages located close to Aurangabad. While the NGO is primarily concerned with obtaining land rights for tribal families, the founders of the NGO and their associates are actively working on many related issues including reforestation, education, research and marketing of non-timber forest products, and fighting for women's rights.

Most of the villages are fairly remote and have had limited exposure to urban centres, but this is beginning to change. Roads and public transportation now connect these villages to neighboring towns and cities. Aurangabad, a rapidly developing small city, is now no more than a few hours' bus ride away for residents of some of these villages. Weekly bazaars draw in people from a number of neighboring villages and also serve as a source of exposure to different cultures and customs since the sellers and wares on display come from many different parts of the country.

The limited amount of exposure that these communities have had to other cultures has resulted in very few changes in lifestyles and diets. Most of the villagers still follow a traditional lifestyle involving farming, animal husbandry, fishing, and some hunting. Thus, the lifestyles, diets, and preferences here could serve as a good baseline to compare other communities with.

There are a few changes that have occurred as a result of inclusion in a market economy, but I believe that these changes will likely be present in any community that I will have access to.
