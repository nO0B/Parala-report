\section{The people}

Lokparyay aims to help many underrepresented and historically subjugated classes of people. Included among these are members of the Bhil, Thakar, and Paradhi tribes, scheduled castes, and a few different nomadic tribes. The people I interviewed during my visit belong to the Bhil tribe. Bhils comprise the majority of the underrepresented in Parala.

There does not seem to be much known about the Bhils. This was strange to me given that they are the third largest scheduled tribe in India. Spatially isolated populations of bhils are present in different regions of western and central India. In total, according to a 2011 census, their population adds up to about 16 million individuals. Their spatial isolation has led to two hypotheses as to their origins:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Either that the term Bhil has been used to describe a number of unrelated forest dwelling tribes
\item Or that the Bhils stem from a single tribe and their current spatial segregation is a result of environmental and social pressures.
\end{enumerate}

There is not much evidence to corroborate or disprove either hypothesis yet.
